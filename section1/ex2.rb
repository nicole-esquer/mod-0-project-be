# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

# study drill 1: I was right because I googled it. But the pound sign or octothorpe is recognized by ruby as a comment and is hidden.
# study drill 2: Attention to detail is important. I'm a relatively fast typer so it's important to check for syntax errors.
# sd 3: No mistakes found
# sd 4: From the driver/navigator sessions in Mod 0, I am building the habit to read out code like this.
