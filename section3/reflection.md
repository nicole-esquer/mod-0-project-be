## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- Pomodoro definitely helped me make time to get up and walk around. Before I would work through large chunks until I realized I'd been sitting at my computer for hours straight.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- I was surprised how much you could accomplish in 25 minutes of focused work.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

- Hash is a collection of keys and their values. It's different from an array because in arrays, the key is a number, and hashes keys can be anything we want it to be.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```ruby
pet_store = {kennels: 4, collars: 15, treats: 50}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```ruby
puts state["IA"]
```

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```ruby
puts states.keys.inspect

puts states.values.inspect
```

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  

- We've been using hashes as a way to organize and keep track of inventory, so they could be used in retail environments or to simplify data. In the Learning Ruby the Hard Way Hashes exercise, we saw how they used the state names and converted them to abbreviations.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

- Hashes are still a very new concept to me, and I am struggling to find material on how to use hashes well.
