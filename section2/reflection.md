## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- I enjoyed when Davy said "people can't focus because they have no patience."

- In the article, I found the acronym SMART helpful. Smart means "Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals."

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- I love to learn and being eager to learn facilitates a growth mindset.

- Kristin Villanueva wrote "you wonâ€™t be asked to tackle a problem completely outside of your repertoire." When I first approached coding, I felt completely overwhelmed learning code by myself. There were so many resources and so many languages. I turned to Turing for help, but in hindsight, I just needed to breakdown my learning process.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

- A conditional statement evaluates conditions by deducing if they are true or false.

```ruby
if x == 3
  puts "x is 3"
end
```

```ruby
if x ==
  puts "x is 3"
elsif  x == 4
  puts "x is 4"
end
```

```ruby
if x == 3
  puts "x is 3"
else
  puts "x is not 3"
end
```

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

- To make decisions based on the state of a situation, to decide if it's true or false.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```ruby
if (condition 1)
  puts code to be executed if condition 1 is true.
elsif (condition 2)
  puts code to be executed if condition 2 is true.
else (condition 3)
  puts code to be executed if condition 3 is true.
end
```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

- To add multiple conditions to an if statement, you can use the elsif to check for another set of criteria.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```ruby
temperature = 75
  if temperature < 80
    puts "I can happily sleep with two blankets."
  elsif temperature == 85
    puts "It's too hot for two blankets!"
  else
    puts "Whatever the temperature, I'll sleep with at least one blanket."
  end
end
```
